### <a name="intro">TL;DR</a>

I've just finished a challenging and satisfying stretch of work at HSBC, and I am ready to continue my professional coding career in a permanent or contractor role.

During this latest engagement our team of six was tasked with delivering smooth interoperability between:
1) an award-winning FX trading platform based on microservices and continuously deployed to production in the spirit of cutting-edge devops and agile principles, and
2) a monolithic legacy corporate payments service with a quarterly release cycle and a huge user base.  

I'm a career-changer who plunged into commercial coding rather late in life. Before that, I used to be a Formula One team member, BBC journalist and desk editor, multilingual video team lead, cameraman, photographer and editor, due diligence analyst, interpreter and translator, and, once, a head of international PR for a supercar startup. With a degree in international law.

My interest in programming brought me to Makers Academy, a leading developer bootcamp, which gave me a solid basis in modern software engineering practices and allowed me to start programming professionally and to be a tutor at Rails events. Subsequent commercial experience in a global bank provided valuable insights into how complex financial software systems are designed, delivered, scaled and maintained. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey.

### <a name="attributes">What I can do</a>

#### Microservices in Clojure

I believe that microservice architecture is optimal for complicated systems, allowing for flexibility, resilience and scalability. **Clojure** is well suited to the task and, besides, I just happen to like it a lot.

Tech: Clojure, Ring, Compojure, Jetty, Cranker (a reverse proxy service)

#### Devops and CI

I worked with [Nic Ferrier](http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/), a self-described 'grizzled hacker', Lisp and Unix guru and a passionate devops advocate. Under his leadership, every dev team in HSBC GFX was responsible for testing and deploying their code to production, as well as supporting it afterwards. The ideology of delivering smallest possible incremental changes (self-tested at startup by automated change tests and automatically rolled back in case of failure) allowed the department to minimise service downtime and production incidents count, keeping the big codebase flexible and maintainable.

Tech: Git, Jenkins, TeamCity, Nexus, Geneos, Splunk, Unix command line tools, HSBC proprietary devops tools (AppRunner, LibraryKeeper, AntMan, sshddd)

#### Object-oriented and functional

**Ruby** was my first love, and, although one can write it in functional or procedural style, I grew up to be a fan of OO Ruby flavour, with Sandi Metz as a principal influencer. I tend to view **JavaScript** as an OO language too. But I really love the purely functional **Clojure** for its elegance.

Tech: Clojure, Ruby (Rails), JavaScript (ES6, Node, jQuery), a bit of Java (Maven)

#### Agile

A much-abused term these days, often heard in the least agile environments imaginable. But when applied properly and in a modern way, daily stand-ups with the team and product owners, continuous release cycle, regular retros and well-maintained ticketing system can do wonders for productivity.

Tech: Jira, Trello, video conferencing tools

#### TDD

Once a firm believer in red-green-refactor and 100% test coverage, I now came to realise that it is not always possible to religiously adhere to this approach in real life with its strict time/budget constraints and pressure to ship code. However, given an opportunity, I'd always write tests. Tests are fun.

Tech: clojure.test, Midje, Selenium, Jasmine, Mocha, RSpec, Capybara

#### Pair programming

I think that working in pairs is more productive, as it allows to learn new things and discuss concepts that you already know, thus reinforcing them in mind.

#### Teamwork

I have considerable experience of working in diverse multilingual teams (as well as leading them) under tight deadlines and liaising with multiple stakeholders.

#### Developer tooling

IntelliJ Idea (with Cursive for Clojure), command line, vi, Atom, Sublime, Spring Tool Suite

#### Stuff that I touched and wouldn't mind going deeper

- Unix tools, Bash scripting
- SQL, Postgres
- Java
- DNS, HTTP, HTTPS
- Authentication
- HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, Wordpress
