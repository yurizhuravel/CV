## Yuri Zhuravel

I'm a junior software developer who at various points in life used to be a Formula One team member, BBC journalist and desk editor, multilingual video team lead, cameraman, photographer and editor, due diligence analyst, interpreter and translator, and, once, a head of international PR for a supercar startup. With a degree in international law.

It took me quite a few fast-paced and enjoyable but not 100% satisfying years to realise that actually, instead of all that, I really want to write awesome test-driven code in a friendly environment of like-minded people. Make computers do cool stuff and have fun in the process. Solve puzzles for a living and learn something new every day. And maybe have a hammock in the office, if I'm lucky.

I take things seriously every time I make a life-changing decision and push myself out of the comfort zone. To upgrade my coding journey from merely putting stuff together in **Wordpress** or **HTML** with a sprinkle of **CSS**, **Javascript** and **Bootstrap**, I've enrolled into **Makers Academy**, a leading bootcamp in the business. From there, things escalated quickly, as illustrated by my commits history from June onwards.

## What I can do

#### I TDD

I believe that overall approach and mindset might be more important in software development than actual technological stack that you run. It is great to be skillful with your tools, but they are not much use if applied erratically. Hence **TDD** - tests first, then red-green-refactor. Makes the design much easier to scale and maintain. As Makers Academy kicks your journey off with Ruby, my most-used test tools were **RSpec** and **Capybara**. I've also done **Jasmine** and **Mocha** when using **Javascript**, and a bit of **NUnit** when trying out **C#**.

#### I absorb new tech quickly

12 weeks at Makers taught me to learn new things at warp pace. I'd never believed this August that in September I'd be building a 3D game reacting to sound input with **Unity** (which I've never heard about before) and **C#**. [Here's the code](https://github.com/yurizhuravel/audiodash), and [here's a playable online version](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/681537).

Earlier, It took our team a week to build an AirBnB logic model, complete with property and user databases, in unfamiliar **Node.js**, with **PostgreSQL** and **Knex**. [Here it is](https://github.com/yurizhuravel/makers_bnb).

Learning to use basic **Rails** in just a couple of days was somewhat easier by comparison, and yielded a really nice result: a tool to search user's GitHub repos for carelessly pushed Facebook secret keys. [Check it out](https://github.com/yurizhuravel/gitsnitch).

#### I pair-program

I believe that working in pairs is more productive, as it allows to learn new things and speak about the stuff that you already know, thus reinforcing it in memory. Flying solo can be fun too, but it's better in a pair.

#### I like clean object-oriented design

**Ruby** was my first love, and Sandi Metz is god. Nuff' said.

#### I don't mind pressure

I've spent a good decade and a half in news, working in real time through scenarios that I honestly hope won't ever happen again (that was one of the reasons I left, actually: news is mostly bad news). There are not many environments out there that could out-pressurize a newsroom on full boil. Well, a Formula One race, maybe. Been there, done that, too. So, yes, bring it on.

#### I can play in a team or lead a team

I'm just starting my professional coding journey and am looking for a junior position. However, I believe that my past experience of working in diverse multilingual teams, as well as leading them, might come in handy for any company that I join.
